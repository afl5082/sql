## SQL Excercise 

This exercise will be based on the [Stack Overflow Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/stack-exchange/stack-overflow?filter=solution-type:dataset&id=46a148ff-896d-444c-b08d-360169911f59) publicly available via Google BigQuery. You can use any Google account and will have free access to 1TB of querying (per month) which should be enough for 50+ queries. Note that tables may need to be referenced with backticks and the full path, e.g. `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.comments`.

Estimated time required: 30-60 minutes

Questions:

1. What are the ten highest-score StackOverflow comments of 2020 by users who have made fewer than 10 comments ever?
2. Assume we measure a user’s “initial comment quality” as the average comment score of their first 10 comments. How has initial comment quality varied for the yearly cohorts of user signups?
3. What’s another interesting factoid you can pull from this dataset?

In your writeup, please include any SQL you used.
